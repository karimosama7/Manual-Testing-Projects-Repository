# 🧪 Manual Testing Projects  

This repository contains my **manual testing projects**, organized into separate folders.  
Each folder represents one project and includes all the essential QA documents.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **/Project-Name/**
  - 📄 **SRS (Software Requirements Specification)** – System requirements for the project.  
  - 📝 **Test Scenarios** – High-level scenarios derived from the SRS.  
  - ✅ **Test Cases** – Detailed test cases with steps, expected results, and actual results.  
  - 🐞 **Defect Report** – Documented bugs/defects found during testing.  
  - 📊 **Test Execution Report** (optional) – Summary of test execution and status.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
This repo demonstrates my ability to:  
- Analyze requirements and create **SRS-based test documentation**.  
- Design **test scenarios and cases** for different projects.  
- Report and track **defects** effectively.  
- Organize QA artifacts in a clear and professional structure.  

## 🚀 How to Navigate  
1. Go to a project folder.  
2. Review the documents inside (SRS, Test Scenarios, Test Cases, Defect Reports).  
3. Each project is independent and self-contained.
